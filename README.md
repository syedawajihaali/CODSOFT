### **Task 1: ChatBot With Rule-Based Responses**

1.	**Objective:** Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriateresponses. This will give you a basic understanding of natura language processing and conversation flow.
   
2.	**Description:** Developed an interactive ChatBot that utilizes predefined rules and pattern recognition in Python to provide thoughtful replies to user questions and participate in discussions. By utilizing a custom dictionary and pattern matching techniques, the ChatBot is capable of delivering informed responses across a range of user inputs, spanning from humorous remarks to requests for information.
   
3.	**Key Features:**
   
    o	Rule-Based response system.

    o	User input analysis using If-else statements.

    o	Engages in enlightening and enjoyable dialogues.

4.	**Execution:** Created a chatbot script featuring predetermined rules for generating responses based on various user inputs.

      
### **Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe Game**

1.	**Objective:** Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.This project will help you understand game theory and basic search algorithms.
   
2.	**Description:** Created an AI agent for the traditional game of Tic-Tac-Toe by implementing the Minimax algorithm for improved performance. The AI player employs tactical moves to optimize its likelihood of victory or achieving a tie. This undertaking offers a deeper understanding of game theory, search algorithms, and the intricacies of decision-making.
   
3.	**Key Features:**
    
     o	An AI-driven adversary utilizing the Minimax algorithm.

     o	Employs tactical moves for an unbeatable performance.
   
     o	Engaging gameplay experience featuring interactions with the AI opponent.
  	
4.	**Execution:** Incorporated the Minimax algorithm to facilitate AI decision-making and seamlessly integrated it into a simulated game of Tic-Tac-Toe.


### Movie Recommendation System (Content-Based Filtering)

1. **Objective:**

Build a simple movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on the content of a user-selected movie. The system uses natural language processing techniques to compare movie descriptions and identify relevant recommendations based on similarity.

2. **Description:**

Developed an interactive movie recommendation system in Python that leverages content-based filtering techniques. By analyzing textual movie descriptions through TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity, the system identifies and suggests movies that closely align with the userâ€™s selected favorite. This application enables users to explore related content in a seamless and intuitive way.

3. **Key Features:**

    o	 Content-Based Recommendation Engine using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity.
    o	 Textual Analysis of Movie Descriptions to determine similarity.
    o	 Interactive Movie Selection Interface allowing user-driven recommendations.
    o	 Scalable System Designâ€”easily extendable with more movies and attributes (e.g., genres, actors).
    o	 Natural Language Processing Integration for analyzing content data.

4. **Execution:** This Python script implements a content-based movie recommendation system by loading movie data, transforming descriptions into TF-IDF vectors, calculating cosine similarity to find similar movies, and then providing the top 3 recommendations based on user input.



These projects collectively showcase adept programming skills and underscore the capability to develop operational and user-centric applications within the domain of artificial intelligence tasks. Each task's code is meticulously structured, harnessing libraries and inherent functionalities to achieve optimal results.
