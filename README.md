### **Task 1: ChatBot With Rule-Based Responses**

1.	**Objective:** Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriateresponses. This will give you a basic understanding of natura language processing and conversation flow.
   
2.	**Description:** Developed an interactive ChatBot that utilizes predefined rules and pattern recognition in Python to provide thoughtful replies to user questions and participate in discussions. By utilizing a custom dictionary and pattern matching techniques, the ChatBot is capable of delivering informed responses across a range of user inputs, spanning from humorous remarks to requests for information.
   
3.	**Key Features:**
   
    o	Rule-Based response system.

    o	User input analysis using If-else statements.

    o	Engages in enlightening and enjoyable dialogues.

4.	**Execution:** Created a chatbot script featuring predetermined rules for generating responses based on various user inputs.

      
### **Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe Game**

1.	**Objective:** Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.This project will help you understand game theory and basic search algorithms.
   
2.	**Description:** Created an AI agent for the traditional game of Tic-Tac-Toe by implementing the Minimax algorithm for improved performance. The AI player employs tactical moves to optimize its likelihood of victory or achieving a tie. This undertaking offers a deeper understanding of game theory, search algorithms, and the intricacies of decision-making.
   
3.	**Key Features:**
    
     o	An AI-driven adversary utilizing the Minimax algorithm.

     o	Employs tactical moves for an unbeatable performance.
   
     o	Engaging gameplay experience featuring interactions with the AI opponent.
  	
5.	**Execution:** Incorporated the Minimax algorithm to facilitate AI decision-making and seamlessly integrated it into a simulated game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

These projects collectively showcase adept programming skills and underscore the capability to develop operational and user-centric applications within the domain of artificial intelligence tasks. Each task's code is meticulously structured, harnessing libraries and inherent functionalities to achieve optimal results.
